## Overview:
In this project, our team worked on developing a website that allows users to interact with data pertaining to the English premier league for the 2020 - 2021 season. The main objective was to enable the user to interact with a single page while also interacting with several visualizations. This provides a more straightforward interface for the user while also providing key metrics. This allows the user to see the top players and teams quickly.   
To develop this site, the team went through a complete ETL process. The steps include:

1. Obtaining data from Kaggle.

2. Cleaning that data in a jupyter notebook.

3. Loading information into a Postgresql database.

4. Creating Flask routes to access Postgresql.

5. Developing javascript to facilitate data visualizations.

6. Creating HTML site to display visualizations.


Throughout this project, we take advantage of various tools such as d3, plotly, and magic mouse javascript libraries. These libraries allow us to establish the behavior of the site, such as the drop-down menus, the charts, and the mouse tracker. Each feature gives the user a unique way to interact with the data and obtain the insights they are looking for. Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, we can easily display our data and analysis visually appealingly and easily referenced by the user.
